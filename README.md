# Title: Aircraft fleet / Repositoriy: saulyaka/aircraft_fleet
# Author: Alla Popova

* Project status: working/dev

# What is it/What does it do:
    The project is developed on Django Framework and containerized in Docker.
    Models: Aircraft and Flight
    For Aircraft CRUD methods avalible by '/api-aircraft/aircraft/'
    For Flight CRUD methods avaliable by '/api-flight/flight/'
    Flight Search/Filtering avaliable by '/api-flight/search/'
        Args: 'departure_datetime_from', 'departure_datetime_ending', 'arrival_airport', 'departure_airport': 'C'
    Flight report avaliable by '/api-flight/report/'
        Args: 'start', 'end'
            The report is generated by departures partially or completely falling within the specified interval.
            And it contains a list of airports, with the number of departures and for each departure, the flight time.
            Example:
                [
                    {
                        "DA": {
                            "number_of_departures": 1,
                            "flights": [
                                {
                                    "id": 7,
                                    "flight_time": 240
                                }
                            ]
                        },
                        "C": {
                            "number_of_departures": 1,
                            "flights": [
                                {
                                    "id": 5,
                                    "flight_time": 240
                                }
                            ]
                        }
                    }
                ]
            
        **Notes:
            All date-time args in  datetime python style
            Given link for ICAO codes gives the codes of 80-x. They were used.

 
# Installation
    In the root directory of the priject:
    Creating image:
        In CL: docker-compose build
    It takes a few minutes. When it finish pulling and creating image you can test it (see below).
        
# Testing
    in CL: docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py test --verbosity 2 --force-color

# UI
    To have for a quick look to functionality Simple UI avaliable by:
        aircrafts CRUD '/api-aircraft/aircraft/'

        flights CRUD '/api-flight/flight/'

        flights search '/api-flight/search/'
                    
        report '/api-flight/report/'
            
    By default db sqlite. If you want to have a look on UI with some data load fixtures
    in CL: in CL: docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py migrate
                  docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py loaddata aircraft.json
                  docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py loaddata flight.json
                  docker-compose up
